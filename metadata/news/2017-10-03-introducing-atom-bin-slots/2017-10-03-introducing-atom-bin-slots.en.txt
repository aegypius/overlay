Starting with Atom 1.21.0-beta0, I will introduce a beta slot for those who want
to test atom releases earlier.

For now you will have to slots:

  - The `stable` slot is now the default one, the ~amd64 flag has been remove
  - The `beta` slot will have a an ~amd64 flag and will feature the next Atom release

If you want to stay in the stable channel, you can safely remove the
app-editors/atom-bin from your package.keywords file.

Please let me know if you have any unexpected behavior.

You can open issues to react to this on https://github.com/aegypius/overlay/issues
