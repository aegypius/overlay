such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

=========
### Create C typed "array" instances on top of Buffers
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/ref-array.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/ref-array)
[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/auxk791h56hbughd?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TooTallNate/ref-array)


This module offers an "array" implementation on top of Node.js Buffers using
the ref "type" interface.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install ref-array
```


Examples
--------

#### Basic usage

``` js
var ref = require('ref')
var ArrayType = require('ref-array')

// typedef
var int = ref.types.int

// define the "int[]" type
var IntArray = ArrayType(int)

// now we can create array instances; the constructor takes the same arguments
// the native JS Array class

var a = new IntArray(5) // by length
a.length // 5
a[0] = 0
a[1] = 1
a[2] = -1
a[3] = 2
a[4] = -2

var b = new IntArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // with an existing Array
b.length // 5
b[0] // 1
b[1] // 2
b[2] // 3
b[3] // 4
b[4] // 5
```

#### Reading a `NULL`-terminated Array

``` js
// sometimes you get a variable length array that is terminated by a NULL byte.
var buf = new Buffer(int.size * 3)
int.set(buf, int.size * 0, 5)
int.set(buf, int.size * 1, 8)
int.set(buf, int.size * 2, 0) // <- terminate with 0s

// you can create an array instance with the length automatically determined
var array = IntArray.untilZeros(buf)
console.log(array.length)
// 2
console.log(array)
// [ 5, 8 ]
```

#### With `node-ffi`

``` js
var ffi = require('ffi')

// the "int[]" type may be used as a "type" in FFI'd functions or callbacks
var func = ffi.ForeignFunction(funcPointer, int, [ IntArray, int ])

var arg = new IntArray(3)
arg[0] = 1234
arg[1] = -9999
arg[2] = 1

var rtn = func(arg, arg.length)
```

array-index
===========
### Invoke getter/setter functions on array-like objects
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/array-index.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/array-index)


This little module provides an `ArrayIndex` constructor function that you can
inherit from with your own objects. When a numbered property gets read, then the
`__get__` function on the object will be invoked. When a numbered property gets
set, then the `__set__` function on the object will be invoked.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install array-index
```


Examples
--------

A quick silly example, using `Math.sqrt()` for the "getter":

``` js
var ArrayIndex = require('array-index')

// let's just create a singleton instance.
var a = new ArrayIndex()

// the "__get__" function is invoked for each "a[n]" access.
// it is given a single argument, the "index" currently being accessed.
// so here, we're passing in the `Math.sqrt()` function, so accessing
// "a[9]" will return `Math.sqrt(9)`.
a.__get__ = Math.sqrt

// the "__get__" and "__set__" functions are only invoked up
// to "a.length", so we must set that manually.
a.length = 10

console.log(a)
// [ 0,
//   1,
//   1.4142135623730951,
//   1.7320508075688772,
//   2,
//   2.23606797749979,
//   2.449489742783178,
//   2.6457513110645907,
//   2.8284271247461903,
//   3,
//   __get__: [Function: sqrt] ]
```

Here's an example of creating a subclass of `ArrayIndex` using `util.inherits()`:

``` js
var ArrayIndex = require('array-index')
var inherits = require('util').inherits

function MyArray (length) {
  // be sure to call the ArrayIndex constructor in your own constructor
  ArrayIndex.call(this, length)

  // the "set" object will contain values at indexes previously set,
  // so that they can be returned in the "getter" function. This is just a
  // silly example, your subclass will have more meaningful logic.
  Object.defineProperty(this, 'set', {
    value: Object.create(null),
    enumerable: false
  })
}

// inherit from the ArrayIndex's prototype
inherits(MyArray, ArrayIndex)

MyArray.prototype.__get__ = function (index) {
  if (index in this.set) return this.set[index]
  return index * 2
}

MyArray.prototype.__set__ = function (index, v) {
  this.set[index] = v
}


// and now you can create some instances
var a = new MyArray(15)
a[9] = a[10] = a[14] = '_'
a[0] = 'nate'

console.log(a)
// [ 'nate', 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, '_', '_', 22, 24, 26, '_' ]
```

API
---

The `ArrayIndex` base class is meant to be subclassed, but it also has a few
convenient functions built-in.

### "length" -> Number

The length of the ArrayIndex instance. The `__get__` and `__set__` functions will
only be invoked on the object up to this "length". You may set this length at any
time to adjust the amount range where the getters/setters will be invoked.

### "toArray()" -> Array

Returns a new regular Array instance with the same values that this ArrayIndex
class would have. This function calls the `__get__` function repeatedly from
`0...length-1` and returns the "flattened" array instance.

### "toJSON()" -> Array

All `ArrayIndex` instances get basic support for `JSON.stringify()`, which is
the same as a "flattened" Array being stringified.

### "toString()" -> String

The `toString()` override is basically just `array.toArray().toString()`.

### "format()" -> String

The `inspect()` implementation for the REPL attempts to mimic what a regular
Array looks like in the REPL.

assert-plus@0.1.5
------------------
License: MIT
# node-assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
	    assert.object(options, 'options');
		assert.number(options.id, 'options.id);
		assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
		assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
		assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
		assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
		callback(null, {});
    }

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
	at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
	at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
	at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
	at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
	at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
	at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
	at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
	at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

    function test(foo) {
	    assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

    function test(foo) {
	    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.arrayOfBool
* assert.arrayOfFunc
* assert.arrayOfNumber
* assert.arrayOfObject
* assert.arrayOfString
* assert.optionalBool
* assert.optionalBuffer
* assert.optionalFunc
* assert.optionalNumber
* assert.optionalObject
* assert.optionalString
* assert.optionalArrayOfBool
* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc
* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber
* assert.optionalArrayOfObject
* assert.optionalArrayOfString
* assert.AssertionError
* assert.fail
* assert.ok
* assert.equal
* assert.notEqual
* assert.deepEqual
* assert.notDeepEqual
* assert.strictEqual
* assert.notStrictEqual
* assert.throws
* assert.doesNotThrow
* assert.ifError

# Installation

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

node-bindings
=============
### Helper module for loading your native module's .node file

This is a helper module for authors of Node.js native addon modules.
It is basically the "swiss army knife" of `require()`ing your native module's
`.node` file.

Throughout the course of Node's native addon history, addons have ended up being
compiled in a variety of different places, depending on which build tool and which
version of node was used. To make matters worse, now the _gyp_ build tool can
produce either a _Release_ or _Debug_ build, each being built into different
locations.

This module checks _all_ the possible locations that a native addon would be built
at, and returns the first one that loads successfully.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install bindings
```

Or add it to the `"dependencies"` section of your _package.json_ file.


Example
-------

`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform
and architecture is as simple as:

``` js
var bindings = require('bindings')('binding.node')

// Use your bindings defined in your C files
bindings.your_c_function()
```


Nice Error Output
-----------------

When the `.node` file could not be loaded, `node-bindings` throws an Error with
a nice error message telling you exactly what was tried. You can also check the
`err.tries` Array property.

```
Error: Could not load the bindings file. Tried:

combined-stream@0.0.7

# combined-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream)

A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install combined-stream
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-stream to combine
two files into one:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream');
var fs = require('fs');

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'));
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'));

combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'));
```

While the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until
they are needed. If you don't want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`
to `false`:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream');
var fs = require('fs');

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false});
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'));
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'));

combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'));
```

However, what if you don't have all the source streams yet, or you don't want
to allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away?
Well, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream
by calling a `next()` function:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream');
var fs = require('fs');

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();
combinedStream.append(function(next) {
  next(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'));
});
combinedStream.append(function(next) {
  next(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'));
});

combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'));
```

## API

### CombinedStream.create([options])

Returns a new combined stream object. Available options are:

* `maxDataSize`
* `pauseStreams`

The effect of those options is described below.

### combinedStream.pauseStreams = `true`

Whether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,
the underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the
underlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when
`delayedStream.pipe()` wants to throttle.

### combinedStream.maxDataSize = `2 * 1024 * 1024`

The maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams.
If this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `'error'` event.

### combinedStream.dataSize = `0`

The amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by `combinedStream`.

### combinedStream.append(stream)

Appends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is
set to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.

`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`
is a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see
example above.

Regardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an
`'error'` listener to it, so you don't have to do that manually.

Special case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.

### combinedStream.write(data)

You should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended
streams into itself for you.

### combinedStream.resume()

Causes `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is
idempotent, and also emits a `'resume'` event each time which usually goes to
the stream that is currently being drained.

### combinedStream.pause();

If `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.
Otherwise a `'pause'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is
currently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.

### combinedStream.end();

Sets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `'end'` event, and removes
all streams from the queue.

### combinedStream.destroy();

Same as `combinedStream.end()`, except it emits a `'close'` event instead of
`'end'`.

# Commander.js

  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).

 [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)

## Installation

    $ npm install commander

## Option parsing

 Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')
  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')
  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')
  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log('you ordered a pizza with:');
if (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');
if (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineapple');
if (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');
console.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);
```

 Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.

## Automated --help

 The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:

```
 $ ./examples/pizza --help

   Usage: pizza [options]

   Options:

     -V, --version        output the version number
     -p, --peppers        Add peppers
     -P, --pineapple      Add pineapple
     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce
     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]
     -h, --help           output usage information

```

## Coercion

```js
function range(val) {
  return val.split('..').map(Number);
}

function list(val) {
  return val.split(',');
}

function collect(val, memo) {
  memo.push(val);
  return memo;
}

function increaseVerbosity(v, total) {
  return total + 1;
}

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .usage('[options] <file ...>')
  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)
  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)
  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)
  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)
  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')
  .option('-c, --collect [value]', 'A repeatable value', collect, [])
  .option('-v, --verbose', 'A value that can be increased', increaseVerbosity, 0)
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log(' int: %j', program.integer);
console.log(' float: %j', program.float);
console.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);
program.range = program.range || [];
console.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);
console.log(' list: %j', program.list);
console.log(' collect: %j', program.collect);
console.log(' verbosity: %j', program.verbose);
console.log(' args: %j', program.args);
```

## Custom help

 You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information
 by listening for "--help". Commander will automatically
 exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program
 does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example
 in the following executable "stuff" will not output when
 `--help` is used.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('../');

function list(val) {
  return val.split(',').map(Number);
}

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')
  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')
  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');

// must be before .parse() since
// node's emit() is immediate

program.on('--help', function(){
  console.log('  Examples:');
  console.log('');
  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');
  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');
  console.log('');
});

program.parse(process.argv);

console.log('stuff');
```

yielding the following help output:

```

Usage: custom-help [options]

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
  -f, --foo      enable some foo
  -b, --bar      enable some bar
  -B, --baz      enable some baz

Examples:

  $ custom-help --help
  $ custom-help -h

```

## .outputHelp()

  Output help information without exiting.

## .help()

  Output help information and exit immediately.

# delayed-stream

Buffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install delayed-stream
```

## Usage

The following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its
response by 1000 ms.

``` javascript
var DelayedStream = require('delayed-stream');
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);

  setTimeout(function() {
    res.writeHead(200);
    delayed.pipe(res);
  }, 1000);
});
```

If you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered
events by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:

``` javascript
var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);

setTimeout(function() {
  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source
  delayed.resume();
}, 1000);
```

## Implementation

In order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should
know about the implementation.

### Event Buffering / Proxying

All events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`
method. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.

However, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the
`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or
not.

Upon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in
an internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all
buffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is
cleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying
source.

### Error handling

Error events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.
However, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `'error'` listener to the
`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`
object, rather than in two places.

### Buffer limits

delayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit
the amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`
streams that don't react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by
default.

## API

### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])

Returns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:

* `pauseStream`
* `maxDataSize`

The description for those properties can be found below.

### delayedStream.source

The `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are
passing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties
on the `source` object.

### delayedStream.pauseStream = true

Whether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling
`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.

### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024

The amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.

If the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`
refers to bytes.

If the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to
characters.

If you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to
disable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.

### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024

The amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.

If the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`
refers to bytes.

If the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to
characters.

If you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to
disable this feature.

### delayedStream.dataSize = 0

The amount of data buffered so far.

### delayedStream.readable

An ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.

### delayedStream.resume()

If the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`
is called.

In either case, `source.resume()` is called.

### delayedStream.pause()

Calls `source.pause()`.

### delayedStream.pipe(dest)

Calls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.

### delayedStream.release()

Emits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not
resume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.

irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have

such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.

following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Growl for nodejs

Growl support for Nodejs. This is essentially a port of my [Ruby Growl Library](http://github.com/visionmedia/growl). Ubuntu/Linux support added thanks to [@niftylettuce](http://github.com/niftylettuce).

## Installation

### Install

### Mac OS X (Darwin):

  Install [growlnotify(1)](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify). On OS X 10.8, Notification Center is supported using [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier). To install:

      $ sudo gem install terminal-notifier

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

      $ npm install growl

### Ubuntu (Linux):

  Install `notify-send` through the [libnotify-bin](http://packages.ubuntu.com/libnotify-bin) package:

      $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

      $ npm install growl

### Windows:

  Download and install [Growl for Windows](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/default.aspx)

  Download [growlnotify](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/growlnotify.aspx) - **IMPORTANT :** Unpack growlnotify to a folder that is present in your path!

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

      $ npm install growl

## Examples

Callback functions are optional

    var growl = require('growl')
    growl('You have mail!')
    growl('5 new messages', { sticky: true })
    growl('5 new emails', { title: 'Email Client', image: 'Safari', sticky: true })
    growl('Message with title', { title: 'Title'})
    growl('Set priority', { priority: 2 })
    growl('Show Safari icon', { image: 'Safari' })
    growl('Show icon', { image: 'path/to/icon.icns' })
    growl('Show image', { image: 'path/to/my.image.png' })
    growl('Show png filesystem icon', { image: 'png' })
    growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' })
    growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }, function(err){
      // ... notified
    })

## Options

  - title
    - notification title
  - name
    - application name
  - priority
    - priority for the notification (default is 0)
  - sticky
    - weither or not the notification should remainin until closed
  - image
    - Auto-detects the context:
      - path to an icon sets --iconpath
      - path to an image sets --image
      - capitalized word sets --appIcon
      - filename uses extname as --icon
      - otherwise treated as --icon

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

single-line-log@0.4.1
------------------
License: MIT
# single-line-log

Node.js module that keeps writing to the same line in the console (or a stream). Very useful when you write progress bars, or a status message during longer operations. Supports multilines.


## Installation

	npm install single-line-log


## Usage

``` js
var log = require('single-line-log').stdout;
// or pass any stream:
// var log = require('single-line-log')(process.stdout);

var read = 0;
var size = fs.statSync('super-large-file').size;

var rs = fs.createReadStream('super-large-file');
rs.on('data', function(data) {
	read += data.length;
	var percentage = Math.floor(100*read/size);

	// Keep writing to the same two lines in the console
	log('Writing to super large file\n[' + percentage + '%]', read, 'bytes read');
});
```

## .clear()

Clears the log (i.e., writes a newline).

``` js
var log = require('single-line-log').stdout;

log('Line 1');
log.clear();
log('Line 2');
```


## .stdout

Outputs to `process.stdout`.


## .stderr

Outputs to `process.stderr`.

stack-trace@0.0.9
------------------
License: MIT
# stack-trace

Get v8 stack traces as an array of CallSite objects.

## Install

``` bash
npm install stack-trace
```

## Usage

The stack-trace module makes it easy for you to capture the current stack:

``` javascript
var stackTrace = require('stack-trace');
var trace = stackTrace.get();

require('assert').strictEqual(trace[0].getFileName(), __filename);
```

However, sometimes you have already popped the stack you are interested in,
and all you have left is an `Error` object. This module can help:

``` javascript
var stackTrace = require('stack-trace');
var err = new Error('something went wrong');
var trace = stackTrace.parse(err);

require('assert').strictEqual(trace[0].getFileName(), __filename);
```

Please note that parsing the `Error#stack` property is not perfect, only
certain properties can be retrieved with it as noted in the API docs below.

## Long stack traces

stack-trace works great with [long-stack-traces][], when parsing an `err.stack`
that has crossed the event loop boundary, a `CallSite` object returning
`'----------------------------------------'` for `getFileName()` is created.
All other methods of the event loop boundary call site return `null`.

[long-stack-traces]: https://github.com/tlrobinson/long-stack-traces

## API

### stackTrace.get([belowFn])

Returns an array of `CallSite` objects, where element `0` is the current call
site.

When passing a function on the current stack as the `belowFn` parameter, the
returned array will only include `CallSite` objects below this function.

### stackTrace.parse(err)

Parses the `err.stack` property of an `Error` object into an array compatible
with those returned by `stackTrace.get()`. However, only the following methods
are implemented on the returned `CallSite` objects.

* getTypeName
* getFunctionName
* getMethodName
* getFileName
* getLineNumber
* getColumnNumber
* isNative

Note: Except `getFunctionName()`, all of the above methods return exactly the
same values as you would get from `stackTrace.get()`. `getFunctionName()`
is sometimes a little different, but still useful.

### CallSite

The official v8 CallSite object API can be found [here][v8stackapi]. A quick
excerpt:

> A CallSite object defines the following methods:
>
> * **getThis**: returns the value of this
> * **getTypeName**: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.
> * **getFunction**: returns the current function
> * **getFunctionName**: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.
> * **getMethodName**: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function
> * **getFileName**: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script
> * **getLineNumber**: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number
> * **getColumnNumber**: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number
> * **getEvalOrigin**: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called
> * **isToplevel**: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?
> * **isEval**: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?
> * **isNative**: is this call in native V8 code?
> * **isConstructor**: is this a constructor call?

taffydb@2.7.2

# TaffyDB (taffy.js)



TaffyDB is an opensouce library that brings database features into your JavaScript applications.



## Introduction



How you ever noticed how JavaScript object literals look a lot like records? And that if you wrap a group of them up in an array you have something that atcs a lot like a database table? TaffyDB brings powerful database funtionality to that concept and rapidly improves the way you work with data inside of JavaScript.



## What makes it sticky



 - Extremely fast

 - Powerful JavaScript centric data selection engine

 - Database inspired features such as insert, update, unique, count, etc

 - Robust cross browser support

 - Easily extended with your own functions

 - Compatible with any DOM library (jQuery, YUI, Dojo, etc)



## Create a DB



Just pass in JSON:



    var products = TAFFY([{

      "item":1,

    	"name":"Blue Ray Player",

    	"price":99.99

    }, {

        "item":2,

        name:"3D TV",

        price:1799.99

    }]);





## Find data



Use JSON to compare:



    var item1 = products({item:1});

    // where item is equal to 1

    var lowPricedItems = products({price:{lt:100}});

	// where price is less than 100

	var blueRayPlayers = products({name:{like:"Blue Ray"}});

	// where name is like "Blue Ray"



## Use data



    // update the price of the Blue Ray Player to 89.99

    products({item:1}).update({price:89.99});

    // loop over the records and call a function

    products().each(function (r) {alert(r.name)});

    // get first record

    products().first();

    // get last record

    products().last();

    // sort the records by price descending

    products.sort("price desc");

    // select only the item names into an array

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."



"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.



2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.



3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.



4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:



You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and



You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and



You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and



If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# debug

  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core's debugging technique.

## Installation

```
$ npm install debug
```

## Usage

 With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.

Example _app.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('http')
  , http = require('http')
  , name = 'My App';

// fake app

debug('booting %s', name);

http.createServer(function(req, res){
  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);
  res.end('hello\n');
}).listen(3000, function(){
  debug('listening');
});

// fake worker of some kind

require('./worker');
```

Example _worker.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('worker');

setInterval(function(){
  debug('doing some work');
}, 1000);
```

 The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:

  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)

  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)

## Millisecond diff

  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.

  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)

  When stderr is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:
  _(NOTE: Debug now uses stderr instead of stdout, so the correct shell command for this example is actually `DEBUG=* node example/worker 2> out &`)_

  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)

## Conventions

 If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".

## Wildcards

  The "*" character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.

  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.  For example, `DEBUG=* -connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:".

## Browser support

 Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`.

```js
a = debug('worker:a');
b = debug('worker:b');

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1000);

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1200);
```

   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

# Commander.js

  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).

 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)

## Installation

    $ npm install commander

## Option parsing

 Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')
  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')
  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')
  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log('you ordered a pizza with:');
if (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');
if (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineappe');
if (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');
console.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);
```

 Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.

## Automated --help

 The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:

```
 $ ./examples/pizza --help

   Usage: pizza [options]

   Options:

     -V, --version        output the version number
     -p, --peppers        Add peppers
     -P, --pineapple      Add pineappe
     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce
     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]
     -h, --help           output usage information

```

## Coercion

```js
function range(val) {
  return val.split('..').map(Number);
}

function list(val) {
  return val.split(',');
}

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .usage('[options] <file ...>')
  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)
  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)
  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)
  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)
  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log(' int: %j', program.integer);
console.log(' float: %j', program.float);
console.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);
program.range = program.range || [];
console.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);
console.log(' list: %j', program.list);
console.log(' args: %j', program.args);
```

## Custom help

 You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information
 by listening for "--help". Commander will automatically
 exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program
 does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example
 in the following executable "stuff" will not output when
 `--help` is used.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('../');

function list(val) {
  return val.split(',').map(Number);
}

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')
  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')
  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');

// must be before .parse() since
// node's emit() is immediate

program.on('--help', function(){
  console.log('  Examples:');
  console.log('');
  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');
  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');
  console.log('');
});

program.parse(process.argv);

console.log('stuff');
```

yielding the following help output:

```

Usage: custom-help [options]

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
  -f, --foo      enable some foo
  -b, --bar      enable some bar
  -B, --baz      enable some baz

Examples:

  $ custom-help --help
  $ custom-help -h

```

## .prompt(msg, fn)

 Single-line prompt:

```js
program.prompt('name: ', function(name){
  console.log('hi %s', name);
});
```

 Multi-line prompt:

```js
program.prompt('description:', function(name){
  console.log('hi %s', name);
});
```

 Coercion:

```js
program.prompt('Age: ', Number, function(age){
  console.log('age: %j', age);
});
```

```js
program.prompt('Birthdate: ', Date, function(date){
  console.log('date: %s', date);
});
```

## .password(msg[, mask], fn)

Prompt for password without echoing:

```js
program.password('Password: ', function(pass){
  console.log('got "%s"', pass);
  process.stdin.destroy();
});
```

Prompt for password with mask char "*":

```js
program.password('Password: ', '*', function(pass){
  console.log('got "%s"', pass);
  process.stdin.destroy();
});
```

## .confirm(msg, fn)

 Confirm with the given `msg`:

```js
program.confirm('continue? ', function(ok){
  console.log(' got %j', ok);
});
```

## .choose(list, fn)

 Let the user choose from a `list`:

```js
var list = ['tobi', 'loki', 'jane', 'manny', 'luna'];

console.log('Choose the coolest pet:');
program.choose(list, function(i){
  console.log('you chose %d "%s"', i, list[i]);
});
```
